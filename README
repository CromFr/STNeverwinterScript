Install notes :

Compiler installation :
	Download the AdvancedScriptCompiler (http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=nwn2plugins.Detail&id=99) and extract the standalone compiler anywhere
	Update the path to NWNScriptCompiler.exe in nwscript.sublime_build (dont forget to use double backslashes)

	Extract the NWN2 script data files (maybe C:\Program Files (x86)\Atari\Neverwinter Nights 2\Data\Scripts*.zip) in a separate directory
	Update the path to the Script directory in nwscript.sublime_build (dont forget to use double backslashes)
	You can delete ncs files from this directory since only nss are required to build

For Linux users :
