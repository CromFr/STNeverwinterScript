# New

- __Dynamic symbol parsing__: Will read nss files to generate function and constants list.
    + User defined symbols are marked with a star
    + Some limitations for default vectors values in functions, written as `[0.0,0.0,0.0]` that are not handled

# Warning

- Don't forget to set `path` setting if needed in _Preferences/Package Settings/STNeverwinterScript/Settings_
