# New

- "Smart" NWScript project builder
    + Caches known NSS files and their relations (which include which).
    + When an include file is modified, rebuilds all other scripts that
      include this file.
    + The first build (since sublime was opened) will build all scripts in the
      current directory. Following builds will be as explained above and much
      faster.
    + Takes advantage of multi-core processors when there are a lot of files
      to compile (each core runs the compiler against a most 30 files).

    + Only windows is supported for now, Linux (<3) is coming soon.

- 2DA syntax highlighting and row indexing.
    + Press CTRL+R and write either the row ID or the first column value to
      move the cursor to the appropriate row.

# Warning

- Settings have been modified, and may need to tweak some fields if you didn't
  install the compiler and scripts at the recommended location.
